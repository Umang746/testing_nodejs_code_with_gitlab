## Overview

Node.js Testing with GitLab is a project designed to automate the testing of Node.js code using GitLab's continuous integration features. It aims to simplify the testing process, catching issues early in the development cycle and ensuring a robust and reliable codebase.

## Features

- **Automated Testing:** Leverage GitLab CI/CD pipelines to automatically run tests on Node.js code upon each push.

- **Node.js Compatibility:** Supports the latest version of Node.js to ensure compatibility with modern JavaScript features.

- **Easy Integration:** Configurable setup allows developers to easily integrate testing into their Node.js projects hosted on GitLab.

## Getting Started

To get started with Node.js Testing on GitLab, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Umang746/testing_nodejs_code_with_gitlab.git
    cd testing_nodejs_code_with_gitlab
    ```

2. **Configuration:**

    Review and modify the GitLab CI configuration file (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) to suit your project's testing requirements.

## Configuration

The primary configuration for this project is handled through the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

```yaml
script: 
    - npm install express
    - node server.js  &
    - sleep 5
    - echo "Webapp started..."
    - curl http://localhost:3000/data | grep -i welcome
```

## Usage

To leverage the automated testing setup in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Push Code Changes:**
   - Make your Node.js code changes.
   - Push the changes to the GitLab repository.

2. **Monitor CI/CD Pipelines:**
   - Visit the GitLab repository.
   - Navigate to the CI/CD pipelines page.

3. **Review Test Results:**
   - Monitor the automated testing process as GitLab runs the defined test scripts.
   - Once the pipeline is complete, review the test results.

4. **Address Issues:**
   - If any issues are identified during testing, review the logs and address the reported problems in your code.

5. **Iterate and Improve:**
   - Make necessary adjustments to your Node.js code based on the test results.
   - Commit and push the changes to trigger subsequent CI/CD pipelines.

6. **Continuous Integration:**
   - Enjoy the benefits of continuous integration, where your Node.js code is automatically tested upon each push, ensuring a reliable and high-quality codebase.

By following this process, you can maintain a robust testing workflow for your Node.js projects, catching potential issues early in development and promoting code reliability.
